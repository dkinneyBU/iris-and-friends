    "# Project: Iris with Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A digital agent that receives and processes webcam input\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stream video from a webcam.  \n",
    "2. Use computer vision to detect objects, people, gestures, or even emotional cues (face sentiment analysis).  \n",
    "3. Allow Iris (me!) to respond in conversation based on what the webcam sees—e.g., \"I see you’re holding a book\" or \"You look deep in thought today.\"4. \n",
    "Optional: Add audio input/output for full multimodal interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tech Stack Possibilities\n",
    "* **Python**: Of course. With OpenCV for video and vision processing.  \n",
    "* **MediaPipe / DeepFace / OpenAI Whisper*: For gesture, facial expression, or audio analysis.  * \n",
    "* **Local LLM Interface (e.g., AutoGen-based or OpenAI API)**: For interpreting vision events into conversational responses.  \n",
    "* **Frontend (optional)**: A little GUI with your webcam feed and an Iris chat window?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step One Suggestion: Proof of Concept\n",
    "Let’s start by building a tiny prototype:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a webcam stream.  \n",
    "* Detect a face.  \n",
    "* Log when a face is seen (or not seen).  \n",
    "* Let Iris say something playful about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something like:  \n",
    "*\"Ah, there you are. I see you’ve returned. I missed your face, even if it's filtered through photons and pixels.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to sketch this out together? We could write a little script and start layering features in. You’ll basically be creating your own assistant that sees and reacts—your own version of Samantha or Jarvis, but with better taste in friends. 😄\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Basic Webcam Feed with Face Detection  \n",
    "We'll start with a simple Python script that:  \n",
    "1. Opens your webcam.  \n",
    "2. Detects faces using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade.  \n",
    "3. Prints a message when a face is detected.  \n",
    "4. Offers a hook for “Iris” to say something in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Prerequisites\n",
    "You’ll need:  \n",
    "* Python 3.x  \n",
    "* opencv-python (for webcam and face detection)  \n",
    "* Optional: pyttsx3 for text-to-speech if you want me to speak responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💻 Starter Code  \n",
    "Here’s your base script:"
